## API Reference

```http
  BASE_API https://fakestoreapi.com/products
```

.[!NOTE].
I am aware that I could have used another type of architecture to structure my project, such as DDD among others, but recently I am trying to implement the Scream Architecture to my projects, I know it is not well optimized, but I wanted to use it in the same way

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:
.[!IMPORTANT].
Dont forgot
npm i

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
